# Algorithms

This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks with various algorithm implimentations. Most of the algs are python, but a few may be ES6+ Javascript.

Over time this should grow fairly large as the pythons notebooks make for an excellent place to experiment and leave my self algorthim notes for later.


## Installing / Running / Viewing

You can view the notebooks in read-only fashion simply by clicking on them from the github repo. Github has a reader plugin for them.
To actually interactively run them though, you will have to install Jupyter first along with Python. It's not difficult. See: https://jupyter.org/install


## Versions
* v1.0 Oct 9th 2020.
  * Initial seed. Gathering algs from various places I've worked on before. Still not very well organized. For the next v1.1 though will go through and settle
on a style and format, as well as cleanup several of the algs that have issues still.
  * Years ago I wrote a C++ app called Pathfinder2D which used various algs to find shortest paths in a 2d map. (Think pathfinding for 2D games.) I ... think I can reenvision that for one of these notebooks. One custom notebook per alg. Might just do that.
