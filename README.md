# Algorithms

This is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks with various algorithm implimentations. Most ofthe algs are python, but a few may be ES6+ Javascript.

## Installing / Running

You can view the notebooks in read-only fashion simply by clicking on them from the github repo. Github has a read for them.
To actually interactivly run them though, you have to install Jupyter first alnog with Python. It's not difficult. See: https://jupyter.org/install

## Versions
* v1.0 Initial seed. Gathering algs from various places I've worked on before. Still not very well origanized. For the next v1.1 though will go through and settle
on a style and format, as well as cleanup several of the algs that have issues still.
